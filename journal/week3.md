# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## Required Homework

### Videos / To-do list

All videos watched and required homework items completed.  Except, at the time of writing this (Saturday 11th March, 20:30 GMT), there is no pricing considerations video and no pricing quiz.  I wanted to submit homework now so that it is submitted in time and to help me keep up with the bootcamp.  If the pricing video (and quiz) is uploaded retrospectively, then I shall return to these when available.

The only video that held me up a bit was the one titled "Cognito JWT Server side Verify."  This was mainly in part owing to the speed of Andrew's rearranging of code!  I enjoyed following along none-the-less, and it was good to follow his lead in searching for solutions / grabbing code from other repos / digging through it to understand what's happening with it.

Something stopped working with my app during this video and I couldn't quite see the error I'd made.  What I ended up doing was looking at Andrew's commit history for the week and comparing our files to see where I'd gone wrong.  Turns out it was an indent error again - this is the second or third time I've been tripped up by this, so I know that I need to pay more attention to this.  Once corrected, everything worked fine.

## Extra

Though not in the required homework list, I particularly enjoyed the video titled "Improving UI Contrast and Implementing CSS Variables for Theming."  I found it helpful in getting me more comfortable with the "inspect" function on web pages and thought it was fascinating to see the colour changes in real-time before even getting into the code.

I have also just started using an app to help me learn JavaScript.  One thing that came in this is that "let" is thought of as a more modern version of "var" to set variables, i.e let name = "John"
I plan to look into this further to understand better what the differences are of these two, if any.  I have only just started to learn code, and little things like this are intriguing.
