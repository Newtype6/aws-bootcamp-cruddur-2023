# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching

## Required videos / tasks

Another tough week.  I had to take a break for a few nights as I was burning out!  Once I came back to it fresh, I was much happier and more confident.
Like a lot of bootcampers I faced some troubles this week but by following along with the videos and chatting through things with others on the discord, as well as reading about other errors some people faced, I have been able to complete week 5 in full and everything is working as it should.

I'm very grateful to Andrew for his amazing instructional videos and also incredibly grateful to some of my fellow bootcampers who clearly have a great deal of experience - I would have struggled to solve some of my issues without help.  Some things I am able to debug on my own now though, and this is a big achievement for me which I'm really happy with, as it's all still very new.  Not sure if this has come up, but I'm an optician - so this is rather different to my usual area of expertise!! 

## The coming weeks

I'm going to be less present in the following weeks, since I have to study for an exam at the end of May.  But I do fully expect to complete the bootcamp, I'll just be a few weeks behind.
